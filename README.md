# otax
hey, welcome to the whistle blow on the apparent "otax" exploit.

so, if you don't know what the "otax" exploit is, it's basically a discord token disclosure, only problem with this apparent "exploit" is, it is fake. <br>
there are 2 versions of "otax", two of which tell about different things, one is about discord WSG (websocket-gateway) analytics and the other is about the API endpoint known as "/science", which is fishy considering they are the same exploit.
